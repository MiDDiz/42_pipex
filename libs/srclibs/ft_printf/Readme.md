# ft_printf [42 Madrid - cursus]

This is a selfcoded implementation of the standart C function ```printf()``` with the exception that it doesn't flush and I haven't implemented some advanced functionalities yet.

It uses some basic helper functions but also uses some functions from my self coded [libft](https://www.github.com/MiDDiz/42_libft) library. Sadly both of them are static libraries so I have to keep a duplicate of the sourcecode that I use in this project, inside the libft folder.

An example of how to use both the [libft](https://www.github.com/MiDDiz/42_libft) and the [ft_printf](https://www.github.com/MiDDiz/ft_printf) function can be seen in this [project template](https://www.github.com/MiDDiz/)
